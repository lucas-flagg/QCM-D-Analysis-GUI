Running QCMDanalysisGUI.m will launch the program for analyzing data from
 the QSense QCM-D instrument.
 This code uses the power-law analysis developed by Shull et al., which is
 a more realistic description of materials than the commonly used Voigt
 model.

 This file provides a guide on how to use the analysis, import data, and
 export results.
 Publication quality plots can be generated directly form this GUI, which
 also provides checks and balances for accurate viscoelastic analysis of
 polymer films whose properties can span from glasses to soft gels in air
 or in liquids.

\series bold
Load QCM-D Data:
\series default
 This button opens a file selection window for you to navigate to your data.
 Your data should be in the format shown in the example files, where the
 appropriate referencing for the shifts is already done manually using the
 absolute frequencies.
 The program assumes you have referenced your shifts with respect to the
 bare crystal frequencies in air if your film is in air, or to the bare
 crystal frequencies in water if your film is in water.
 For a bulk measurement of a viscous liquid, the reference is the bare crystal
 in air.
 The code will read only excel files with the extension .xlsx.
 If you have a .xls file, simply changing the extension to .xlsx should make
 things work.
 Note the dissipation factor is used in the data, but a conversion is made
 to represent this as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\Gamma$
\end_inset

 using Eq.
 1.

Bulk Calculation:
\series default
 If you are measuring a bulk viscous liquid, then load your data and hit
 this button.
 A pop up figure will appear with your solutions.
 Here you can use the 'bare crystal in water' file as an example to see
 the properties of water at different harmonics.
 The bulkcalc_Callback function near the end of the main code is called,
 and you can make changes to the plots here according to your needs.

\series bold
Plot QCM Data:
\series default
 This file will plot the solutions for your film in water or your film in
 air.
 Make sure the correct radio button is selected for your situation.
 Note 
\begin_inset Formula $dp$
\end_inset

 is written in 
\begin_inset Formula $mg/m^{2}$
\end_inset

 which is approximately the film thickness in nanometers is a density of
 
\begin_inset Formula $1g/cm^{3}$
\end_inset

 is assumed.
 Likewise the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho|G_{3}^{*}|$
\end_inset

 is the complex shear modulus at 15 MHz.
 This quantity is 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx10^{5}Pa-g/cm^{3}$
\end_inset

 for water, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx3*10^{9}$
\end_inset

 for polymer glasses.
 The phase angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is 90 for a Newtonian liquid like water, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx1^{o}$
\end_inset

 for an elastic solid like a polymer glass.

Viscoelastic plots:
\series default
 This button will show you the viscoelastic plots outside the main GUI.
 The export_callback near the end of the main code is used to make these
 plots.
 You can change the way things are plotted here to customize for your publicatio
n needs.
 Only results for the 3:5,5 calculation are shown.
\end_layout

\series bold
Thickness plots: 
\series default
This button will show you the 
\begin_inset Formula $d/\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 and also the predicted shifts from your solutions.
 In this analysis, we exclusively only use the 3:5,5 calculation, therefore
 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\Gamma_{3}$
\end_inset

 as a free parameter for a consistency check.
 If the code solved correctly, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta f_{3},\Delta f_{5}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\Gamma_{5}$
\end_inset

 (3:5,5) should all have the experimental shifts and predicted shifts match
 exactly.
 The difference in the experimental and predicted value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\Gamma_{3}$
\end_inset

 should be as small as possible.
 In most real cases a small discrepancy in the predicted and experimental
 value is acceptable.
 Here, the thicknessplots_Callback near the end of the main code is called
 to make the plots.
 You can customize the output according to your needs.

Refresh:

Relaunches the GUI and clears the memory.
 Useful if an error is encountered, or if you just want a clean new window.

\series bold
Range to solve:
\series default
 By default we solve every point.
 However, if the data set is large then it is desirable to solve only a
 portion of the data with larger intervals.
 For example, inputting 100:5:500 into the edit text boxes will solve every
 fifth point between the 100th and 500th data points.

Save plots:
\series default

 exported into the working directory when 'Viscoelastic Plots' and 'Thickness
 Plots' are clicked.

Export Data:
\series default
 This button outputs a tab-delimited text file into the working directory
 with all the relevant values.
 This is useful if you want to do your own plotting outside MATLAB.

Handles:
\series default
 This allows you access into MATLAB's handle structure where all the data
 is stored internally.
 After you have solved for solutions, click this button and MATLAB will
 open the workspace in debugging mode.
 Here, there will be a new variable called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Handles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the workspace.
 If you double click this, then the internal data structure is repealed.
 For example, the variable phiout{1} stores all the phase angles from the
 3:5:3 calculation, and phiout{2} stores all 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 from the 3:5,5 calculation.
 Likewise, the variable d5out stores 
\begin_inset Formula $d/\lambda_{5}$
\end_inset

.
 To leave the handle structure, click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Quit Debugging

 in the main MATLAB window.

\begin_inset Formula $d/\lambda_{n}$

General notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
1) The code is pretty good at finding missing values if some of your data
 is missing.
 However, there is a chance data import may fail if there are too many missing
 data points, or if the data columns are of varying lengths.
 You may have to manually clean the data before importing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
2) The GUI has zoom, grab and data cursor functionality enabled.
 You can select the data cursor, and then click on individual points for
 the exact values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
3) Often, if the shifts do not solve (maybe because your film is too thin),
 then the calculation will return non-sense for modulus and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 For example, all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 will be 90, which is the upper bound on the numerical solver.
 However, even if the code does not solve because your film is too thin,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $d\rho$
\end_inset

 value is reliable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
4) See figure 6a in Anal.
 Chem.
 2018, 90, 4079−4088 to gain intuition on how 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho|G_{n}^{*}|$
\end_inset

 are correlated.
 See Figure 8a to understand the approximate thickness ranges needed for
 accurate viscoelastic analysis.
 In general, the stiffer the material, the thicker it has to be for being
 in the optimal viscoelastic regime.
 Polymer glasses such as polystyrene need 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx5\mu m$
\end_inset

 films, while polymer gels/complexes need 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx1\mu m$
\end_inset

 films.
 The maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\Gamma_{n}$
\end_inset

 that is trustworthy is 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx10,000$
\end_inset

 Hz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
5) The code is written in MATLAB 2018a.
 Version specific errors may occur, especially if you are on a much older
 version.
 Generally, 2015a and up should work fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
6) A good crystal with a reliable response should have absolute 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma<100$
\end_inset

 Hz for the measured harmonics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
7) We plot 
\begin_inset Formula $d\rho$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $mg/m^{2}$
\end_inset

, which is the areal mass of the film.
 Here, if you assume your film is 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx1g/cm^{3}$
\end_inset

 then 1000 
\begin_inset Formula $mg/m^{2}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx1\mu m$
\end_inset

.
